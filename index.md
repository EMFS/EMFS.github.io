Hello and welcome to this blog on Machine Learning!

A lot of content will be drawn from my experience with [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)

Example of a decision tree drawn with dtreeviz on the Enem 2-19 dataset, showing which factors are more important do predict the family income of students that have taken the Enem exam from their socio-economic characteristics:

## Analysis of ENEM data

Datasets on public education in Brazil are published, with great quality, by [INEP](http://download.inep.gov.br/microdados/)

The specific dataset for ENEM 2019 can be obtained [here](http://download.inep.gov.br/microdados/microdados_enem_2019.zip) (635 MB zipped, 3 GB unzipped!)
